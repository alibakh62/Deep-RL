# Study Plan

The second part of this nanodegree program covers value-based methods in deep reinforcement learning and lasts  **3 weeks**. You can find all of the coding exercises from the lessons in this  [GitHub repository](https://github.com/udacity/deep-reinforcement-learning).

## Weeks 1-2

----------

For the first two weeks, you will learn more about how deep learning is used to increase the complexity of the problems we can solve with reinforcement learning.

#### Lesson: Deep Q-Networks

In this lesson, you will learn all of the details behind the Deep Q-Networks (DQN) algorithm.

#### Lesson: Deep Learning with PyTorch (_Optional_)

We will use PyTorch throughout this program. If the PyTorch framework is new to you, please take a look at our introductory lesson in the extracurricular content.

#### Lesson: Neural Networks (_Optional_)

For this course, you are expected to know how neural networks train through backpropagation. If youâ€™d like to review this material, we have prepared this lesson in the extracurricular content.

#### Lesson: Convolutional Neural Networks (_Optional_)

If you'd like to review convolutional neural networks, check out this lesson in the extracurricular content.

#### Lesson: Deep RL in Robotics (_Optional_)

Learn about how to use the Deep Q-Learning algorithm with real-world robotics from experts at NVIDIA's Deep Learning Institute.

#### Readings

-   Read this  [scientific article](https://www.cs.swarthmore.edu/~meeden/cs63/s15/nature15a.pdf)  that describes Deep Q-Networks.
-   Read the  [research paper](https://storage.googleapis.com/deepmind-media/dqn/DQNNaturePaper.pdf)  that first introduced the Deep Q-Learning algorithm.

#### Resources

-   Learn more about Deep Q-Learning and Google DeepMind by watching this  [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xN1d3qHMIEQ).

## Week 3

----------

For the final week, you will focus on the project.

# Deep RL for Robotics

Watch the video below to hear how deep RL is being applied in robotics from  **Dana Sheahen**, the Curriculum Lead for the  [Robotics Software Engineer Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/robotics-software-engineer--nd209).

See the video [here](https://youtu.be/IjG_IWJdb1w).

In the next lesson, you'll learn all about  **Deep Q-Networks**.

Then, in the lesson  **Deep RL for Robotics**, you will learn how to use Deep Q-Learning to train a robotic agent to drive in a  [Gazebo](http://gazebosim.org/)  environment.
