**NOTE:** At this point, the "latex.codecogs.com" equation renderer that I use for all the math equations in the notes is not working. So, from this point on (proximal policy lesson, credit assignment section), I will write the latex codes directly. _Probably, most the equations I wrote using this website is not rendering throughout the notes, so they need to be fixed at some point as well._
